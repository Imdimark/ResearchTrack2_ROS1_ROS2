# Research track 2 
## assignment 1

Inside the package:
1. Launch folder, it contains two different files:
2.  sim.launch
3. Script folder
4. Src folder
5. Urdf

You will launch:
* the simulation environment
* the node PositionServer, which implements a random position service
* the node GoToPoint, which implements a service to drive a robot toward a point in the environment
* the node FSM, which implements a service to start or stop the robot, and calls the other two services to drive the robot
* the UserInterface, which asks the user to start/stop the robot, and calls the service implemented in the FSM node

You can then run:
roslaunch rt2_assignment1 sim.launch
The launch file will open:
- a Gazebo simulation with a simple mobile robot
- four nodes which implement the robotâ€™s behaviourv
